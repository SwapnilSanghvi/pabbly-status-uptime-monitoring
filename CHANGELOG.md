## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-15

### Fixed

#### Cloudflare 520/525 Connection Errors

Fixed intermittent 520 and 525 errors when monitoring APIs behind Cloudflare by disabling HTTP connection reuse.

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/services/monitorService.js` - Added custom undici Agent with connection reuse disabled
- `backend/package.json` - Added `undici` dependency

**Root Cause:**
Node.js native `fetch()` reuses TCP connections by default (HTTP keep-alive). When monitoring APIs behind Cloudflare:
- Stale connections caused **520 errors** (Cloudflare closed the connection, but client tried to reuse it)
- Expired SSL sessions caused **525 errors** (SSL handshake failed on reused connection)

**Solution:**
```javascript
import { Agent } from 'undici';

const httpAgent = new Agent({
  keepAliveTimeout: 1,
  keepAliveMaxTimeout: 1,
  connections: 10,
  pipelining: 1,
});

// Use dispatcher option in fetch
fetch(url, { dispatcher: httpAgent });
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates random 520/525 errors for Cloudflare-proxied endpoints
- Each monitoring request uses a fresh TCP connection
- Minimal latency impact (~50-100ms) which is negligible for 1-minute intervals

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-14

### Added

#### HTTP Status Code in Webhook Notifications

Added `status_code` field to webhook payloads and incident tracking.

**Files Changed:**
- `database/schema.sql` - Added `status_code` column to incidents table
- `database/migrations/003_add_incident_status_code.sql` - Migration for existing databases
- `backend/src/services/monitorService.js` - Pass status code to incident handlers
- `backend/src/services/incidentService.js` - Store and pass status code
- `backend/src/services/webhookService.js` - Include status code in webhook payload

**Before:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "api_down",
  "incident": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My API is down",
    "status": "ongoing"
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "api_down",
  "incident": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My API is down",
    "status": "ongoing",
    "status_code": 503
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**
| Event | `status_code` Value |
|-------|---------------------|
| `api_down` | The error code that caused the failure (e.g., 500, 503, 404) |
| `api_up` | The recovery code (e.g., 200) confirming the API is healthy |

**Benefits:**
- Webhook consumers can now identify the exact HTTP error that caused the incident
- Recovery webhooks confirm the API is returning the expected status code
- Better integration with automation tools and alerting systems
- Improved incident reporting and debugging capabilities

**Migration Required:**
```bash
docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres -d status_monitor < database/migrations/003_add_incident_status_code.sql
```

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/services/emailService.js` - Completely redesigned both downtime and recovery email templates

  - Recovery: `🟢 RESOLVED: [Service Name] is Back Online`
- **Compact headers:** Reduced padding (16px) with lighter background colors for better aesthetics
- **Status code tracking:** Displays both error codes (500, 503, etc.) and recovery codes (200)
- **Clean information hierarchy:** Removed redundant "Status: Resolved" badge in recovery emails
- **Inline styles:** All CSS is inline for maximum email client compatibility
- **Responsive design:** Works on both desktop and mobile email clients
- **Action buttons:** Clear "View Status Page" CTA linking to frontend
- **Visual indicators:** Color-coded headers (red for alerts, green for recovery)

**Email Client Compatibility:**
- Gmail (Web & Mobile)
- Outlook (Desktop & Web)
- Apple Mail
- Yahoo Mail
- Thunderbird
- All major email clients

**Benefits:**
- Clear, grammatically correct subject lines without incident numbers
- Emoji indicators (🔴/🟢) at the start of subject for quick visual recognition
- HTTP status codes included for both downtime and recovery events
- Structured table-based layout that renders consistently across email clients
- Professional appearance with appropriate spacing and color scheme
- Quick access to status page via button link

### Changed

#### Reduced Console Logging for Better Performance

Removed verbose logging to improve performance and reduce log storage.

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/config/database.js` - Removed query execution logs
- `backend/src/server.js` - Removed HTTP request logging middleware

**Before:**
```
Executed query { text: 'SELECT * FROM apis...', duration: 5, rows: 10 }
2026-01-13T11:59:19.515Z - GET /api/admin/dashboard-stats
2026-01-13T11:59:19.524Z - GET /api/public/status
✅ Connected to PostgreSQL database
✅ Connected to PostgreSQL database
✅ Connected to PostgreSQL database
```

**After:**
```
(clean console - only important logs like API UP/DOWN events)
```

**What Was Removed:**
| Log Type | Reason for Removal |
|----------|-------------------|
| `Executed query {...}` | Logged every database query - extremely verbose |
| `GET /api/...` request logs | Logged every HTTP request - noisy |
| `✅ Connected to PostgreSQL` | Logged on every pool connection - repetitive |

**What Was Kept:**
| Log Type | Reason for Keeping |
|----------|-------------------|
| `🔴 API DOWN: ...` | Critical - alerts when API goes down |
| `🟢 API UP: ...` | Critical - confirms API recovery |
| `📋 Created incident #...` | Important - tracks incident creation |
| `❌ Database pool error` | Critical - prevents silent failures |

**Benefits:**
- Reduced log storage consumption
- Easier to find important events in logs
- Minimal performance improvement (reduced I/O operations)
- Cleaner development console output
